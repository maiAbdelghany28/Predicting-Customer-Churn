## Project Structure

- `Customer_Churn_Prediction_Code.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
  - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
  - Final insights

## Features

- Import and clean raw customer data
- Visualize churn patterns with graphs and correlation matrices
- Encode categorical variables and scale features
- Train multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest (if included)
- Evaluate models using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn
